#MarkDown Language Basic#    


After server months delay, my personal [blog]:(http://wutingbupt.github.com/blog) was successfully created.

And now, it is time for me to learn some basic knowledge about markdown, so that I can continue with my blog.  
    

Ok, before we start, let's introduce following key word:

\    backslash    
\`    backtick    
\*   asterisk    
\_   underscore    
{}  curly braces    
[]  square brackets    
()  parentheses    
\#    hash mark    
\+   plus sign    
\-   minus sign (hyphen)    
\.   dot   
!   exclamation mark    

##How to create headers
Currently, there are two ways.

1.

This is an H1    
/=============
=============


This is an H2    
/-------------
-------------

2. 

#\# This is an H1

##\## This is an H2

######\###### This is an H6

So for me, the second way is more easier :)

## How to using quotes
Do you know how we do this when you reply a email? Yeap, it is the sameting like you reply a email

Such as:    
> I was quoted :)    
> Just the same like you reply a email.    
> Wow, it is amazing    

## How to using the LISTS

\* is a good choice for you.

* list1
* list2
* list3

Or you can directly using someting like this:
1. first
2. second
3. three

## How to show the code
If you want to show the code: try using \`.

`System.out.println("Hello World)`
